This is an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes in prolog, here's an example of how to run the code.
```
C:\Users\ExampleUser\sieve_prolog>swipl sieve.pl
What is the upper limit for the prime number computations?
|: 100
[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97]
There are 25 primes in this list.
```
Note: this example uses SWI Prolog, but other may be used, however I haven't tested them.
